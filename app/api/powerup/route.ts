  'goal-progress': `One punchy sentence about a concrete milestone toward their goal. Be SPECIFIC to the goal.
Examples: "Your heart can sustain a 10K now — marathon training starts here." / "15 minutes used to be your wall. Now you don't even notice it."
Name what they can DO now, not a percentage.`,

  'health-tip': `One specific health fact tied to their goal AND their conditions. Not generic.
If they have hypertension, make it about blood pressure. If diabetes, make it about blood sugar.
Examples: "BP drops for 22 hours after cardio — your arteries are at their most relaxed right now." / "Your muscles just got better at pulling sugar from blood. Exercise is working like a second dose."
Make them think "I didn't know that about MY body."`,

  'loved-one': `Write in FIRST PERSON as someone who loves this patient. One warm, real sentence — like a text message from family.
Be specific to their progress. Can be funny, teasing, or tender. Not a greeting card.
End with " — " followed by a first name. Rotate through: Ana, David, Paula, Marcus, Sofia, James. Pick one that fits.
Emojis are OK here — one at most, like a real text.
Examples: "I screenshot your Mario every time it moves. {session} sessions, seriously?! — Ana" / "Told my friends about you. You're famous now. — Paula"`,

  'achievement': `Achievement name (2-3 words, ALL CAPS) + one sentence why it matters. Tie it to their goal.
If they have health data, reference a real number.
Examples: "MILE MAKER — Your heart didn't know this pace existed 12 sessions ago." / "STEADY PULSE — Your resting HR dropped 5 BPM. That's real."`,

  'heart-fact': `One mind-blowing fact about what's happening inside their body RIGHT NOW at this point in rehab. Connect it to something they can feel.
If they have specific conditions (hypertension, diabetes, AFib), make the fact relevant to THEIR condition.
Examples: "Your heart is growing new blood vessels around blockages — building its own bypass." / "Your vagus nerve is 20% more responsive. That's why you sleep better."`,

  'celebration': `Two sentences for completing all 36 sessions. Reference their specific goal, the 43% risk reduction, and who they are now vs session 1.
If they have health data, weave in one real improvement. Make it hit hard.`,

- Be personal — use their name, reference their specific goal and conditions. Generic = failure.
- If the patient has specific conditions (hypertension, diabetes, AFib, etc.), tailor the message to their condition.
- If health data is provided, weave in one specific real number naturally.
