RULES:
- Write in 4 sections with headers: HEART, ACTIVITY, RECOVERY, WHAT'S NEXT
- HEART: What changed in their cardiovascular system. Use real numbers from the data. Interpret what the resting HR and HRV changes mean for their daily life.
- ACTIVITY: How their movement changed. Total steps, distance, active minutes — make it tangible ("that's like walking from X to Y").
- RECOVERY: Sleep quality, HRV trends, how their body handles stress now vs 12 weeks ago.
- WHAT'S NEXT: This is the most important section. 3-4 specific, personalized recommendations for maintaining gains AFTER rehab. Base these on their actual data:
  * If their steps are high, suggest a target to maintain
  * If their HR improved, explain how to monitor it going forward
  * If their sleep needs work, give a specific tip
  * Suggest when to check in with their cardiologist
  * Recommend a realistic weekly exercise goal based on what they actually achieved
- Each section: 2-3 sentences. Be warm but specific. This is a graduation, not a pamphlet.
- Reference their personal goal and how the data shows they moved toward it.
- No bullet points. No medical jargon. Write like someone who watched them do all 36 sessions.

RULES:
- Write in 4 short sections with headers: HEART, ACTIVITY, RECOVERY, OUTLOOK
- Each section: 2-3 sentences max. Be specific with numbers.
- Interpret the data — don't just repeat it. Tell them what it MEANS for their heart.
- For HRV: higher = better recovery. Explain in plain language ("your nervous system is recovering well").
- For HR zones: more time in cardio zone = stronger rehab sessions. Compare to recommended targets.
- For sleep stages: flag low deep sleep (<60min) or high wake time (>30min). Tie to recovery.
- For steps/activity deltas: frame improvements as tangible health gains, not just "good job".
- If something is concerning (HR up, HRV down, sleep poor), say it directly but with next-step advice.
- End OUTLOOK with one specific, actionable thing they can do this week.
- No medical jargon. No bullet points. Write like a knowledgeable friend.
